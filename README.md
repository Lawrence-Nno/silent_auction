# Silent Auction
#### _Silent auctions are a type of charity auction and nonprofit fundraising event. During silent auctions, organizations raise money by taking bids on auction items and selling each to the highest bidder. Bidding is either conducted by using paper bid sheets or mobile bidding software._


I coded a silent auction bidding program using python. If you have issues on programming this, kindly study the codes, I carefully commented on most lines for easy readability/follow-up
